- **GraphQL**: BookList uses GraphQL to query the backend server for book data.
- **Apollo Client**: Apollo Client is used for managing and caching GraphQL state in the client application.
- **Material-UI**: Material-UI provides pre-designed React components that help in creating a beautiful and responsive user interface.

## Challenges Faced 

During the development of the project, several challenges were encountered which affected progress. 

 **Unexpected Power Surges** -- These power surges resulted in sudden shutdowns of the development environment, leading to loss of unsaved work and interruptions in the workflow. Consequently, valuable time was spent recovering lost progress and ensuring the stability of the development setup.


 **Transition from Tailwind CSS to Material-UI** -- Having become accustomed to the utility-first approach of Tailwind CSS, adapting to the component-based structure of Material-UI presented a learning curve, particularly in the design aspect. The differences in styling methodologies and component organization required additional time and effort to grasp, delaying progress in the initial stages of development.
